    "What if the “Yes”/”No” answers in “Fever” were replaced with actual temperature readings ? How would we compile the tree then? Don’t panic, the process very similar to before. First we sort the values of the attribute in ascending order (smallest to largest). Then we compute the average for all adjacent patients. For example, if the first two values were 10 and 20, we’d get the average of those two values (average = (10+20)/2 = 15) and insert the value in between 10 and 20.\n",

In the picture above we have selected the value 37.5 (average of 37 and 38) and used it as the attribute in the root node. It asks the question: which patients have a fever less than 37.5 degrees celsius? If the answer is Yes (True) then it goes into the left node, otherwise it goes into the right node. Can you see that we follow the same notion as before. After fulfilling our node we must calculate the Gini impurity score for the node (with “Fever < 37.5” as the attribute). To obtain the Gini score we do the same as before: calculate Gini scores for the leaf nodes and then using weighted average methods we get the Gini impurtiy score for the root node.\n",
    "This process is done for all averages. The average which returns the lowest Gini impurity score is selected to be the cut-off value in the root node or parent node."
